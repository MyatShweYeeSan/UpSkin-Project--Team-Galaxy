<h1>Knowledge about skincare</h1>
<p>"Skincare" isn't just a tool for your skin. If you really get into skincare, buying and trying more will become your new hobby! And that's not a bad thing. 
You can learn a lot about the ingrediants and skincare products like a pro! Here, we'll tell the basics of skincare that you might need later!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>First of all!</h2>
<br>
<h3>Skincare steps:</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Step 1: Cleansers

A facial cleanser is a skincare product used to remove make-up, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and other types of pollutants from the skin, helping to keep pores clear and 
prevent skin conditions such as acne. Cleansing is one of the most essential part of skincare! It keeps your skin clean, away from bacteria. Think like this, you put on 
so many layers of skincare, and the next day, you have nothing to wash the layers off! That's a terrible situation. You might think cleanser types don't really matter, 
but they actually do! Water-based cleaners are holy grail for skin girls, and for dry skin, cream/foam types are more recommended.

<p><pre>Step 2: Toners

Toners balance your skin pH which is great for sebum control, and from your skin going to dry.  It comes in a water-based liquid form that may be infused 
with skin-soothing ingredients like eucalyptus, peppermint and aloe. A toner's job is meant to gently refresh your skin without stripping it of its natural moisture.
Toners also removes any last traces of dirt, grime and impurities stuck in your pores after you wash your face. There can be types of toners too, such as water-based
toners, milky toners, hybrid(water-based + milk) toners, etc. There can be gentle and strong toners, which you choose to your likeness. When added to your daily 
skincare routine and used regularly, it can have major positive impact on the appearance and tightness of your pores

<p><pre>Step 3: Essences

Essence is a water-based skin care product that contains a high content of active ingredients to hydrate, protect, and boost the overall health of skin. 
When essence is applied to clean skin after using a cleanser and toner, it helps restore hydration to the skin cells. When it’s applied before serums and moisturizers, 
it helps the skin better absorb these products. You can skip this step if you want! You can use serums instead of essences. Essences have a thicker texture than serums, 
which can be hard to blend sometimes, but they're awesome if you have dry skin!</pre></p>

<p><pre>Step 4: Treatment

A skin treatment can help you achieve younger looking skin by increasing your skin’s elasticity, improving textural irregularities, tightening facial contours, 
and of course, reducing fine lines and wrinkles, thus erasing years from your appearance without any invasive procedures. You can usually avoid this, 
if you don't have any serious skin concerns!</pre></p>

<p><pre>Step 5: Moisturizer

A face moisturizer is a lotion, or cream emulsion, ointment or balm formulated with emollients that help skin stay hydrated. Moisturizers hydrate the surface layers 
of the skin. Their main skin benefit is that they seal the skin, locking in moisture and nutrients, while protecting the skin from environmental irritants. The 
simplest of face moisturizers prevent and hydrate dry skin, but that's not all they can do. With continued use, moisturizers can improve the skin barrier. 
Moisturizers with antiaging ingredients can also soothe sensitive skin and improve skin tone and texture, while helping skin to look firmer and healthier. 
Using a moisturizer over a serum will help lock in the serum actives and nutrients.</pre></p>

<p><pre>Step 6: Eye cream/Serum(PM recommended)

Eye creams are moisturizing products that have been formulated with the specific needs of your delicate eye area in mind. Adding an eye cream to your daily skincare 
routine can help keep this skin moisturized to prevent dryness, while also helping to maintain a healthy skin barrier and promoting under-eye skin that appears 
smoother, plumper, and firmer. When used consistently as part of your daily regimen, eye creams can also help reduce the look of multiple signs of aging and fatigue 
around the eyes, and provide important moisture and care to this fragile area.</pre></p>

<p><pre>Step 7: Sunscreen

Sunscreens are used to protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun. They help to prevent sunburn and premature aging (such as wrinkles, leathery skin). 
Sunscreens also help to decrease the risk of skin cancer and also of sunburn-like skin reactions (sun sensitivity) caused by some medications (including tetracyclines, 
sulfa drugs, phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine).The active ingredients in sunscreens work either by absorbing the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation, preventing it 
from reaching the deeper layers of the skin, or by reflecting the radiation.Wearing sunscreen does not mean that you can stay out longer in the sun. Sunscreens cannot 
protect against all of the sun's radiation.There are various types of sunscreens available in many forms (such as cream, lotion, gel, stick, spray, lip balm).</pre></p>
<br>

<h2>Types of sunscreens</h2>
<br>
<p><pre>There are two main types of sunscreens:

● Mineral/Physical

● Chemical

There's also a mix of both:

● Hybird

The active ingredients in sunscreens work by creating UV filters that keep harmful UV rays from penetrating the skin. Each type uses a different mechanism for 
filtering UV rays and protecting the skin from damage.</pre></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Mineral/Physical Sunscreen</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>This type woud be a safer option if you have acne-prone/sensitive skin. They mostly are non-comedogenic and have full protection. Mineral sunscreens sit on top of 
the skin’s surface, acting as a physical blocker by deflecting and scattering UV rays away from the skin like tiny mirrors. Because they block UV rays at the surface 
level, mineral sunscreens protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Also, because mineral sunscreens create a physical barrier, they are effective as soon as they are 
applied, so there is no need to wait. Mineral sunscreens tend to have a white-ish cast to them, and can be visible on the skin. Also, because they sit on the skin’s 
surface, mineral sunscreens can be rubbed, sweated, or rinsed off easily, which makes frequent reapplication a necessity.

● Pros: Full protection from UVA and UVB rays; effective immediately; will not clog pore.

● Cons: Frequent reapplication is needed; may leave a white cast on the skin; spray and loose powder formulations should be avoided.</pre></p>

<br>
<h3>Chemical Sunscreen</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Chemical sunscreens are absorbed into your skin and sit in the deeper layers. They absorb UV rays and change them into heat, then release the heat from the skin.
Since UV rays must penetrate the skin to reach these chemicals, chemical sunscreens may not protect against all UVA rays, which still causes damage to the deeper 
layers of the skin.Because chemical sunscreens take about 20 minutes to be effective, planning is required. Also, direct light caused the chemicals to be used up more 
quickly, so reapplication must be more frequent when you are in direct sunlight. The heat-releasing nature of chemical sunscreens can be problematic for sensitive 
and rosacea-prone skin, as well as for individuals with hyperpigmentation. The heated skin can cause an increase in existing brown spots. Chemical sunscreens can 
also clog pores and be problematic for acne-prone skin. Chemical sunscreens contain oxybenzone, avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, octisalate, homosalate, 
or combinations thereof.

● Pros: Less product is needed per application to offer protection; thinner and easier to spread on the skin; applies invisibly.

● Cons: Allows some UVA exposure; requires time to be effective; can exacerbate acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation; frequent application required.</pre></p>

<h2>Ingrediants in Skincare products that you might need!</h2>
<br>
<h3>Niacinamide</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3, which your body needs to help maintain healthy-looking skin. There are three forms of vitamin B3—niacinamide (nicotinamide), 
niacin (nicotinic acid), and nicotinamide riboside—but niacinamide is the ingredient that’s most popularly used in skincare products. It’s most commonly-known for 
its skin-brightening and hydrating properties, niacinamide’s skin benefits also include its ability to help calm your skin, reduce the appearance of redness, and 
improve uneven skin texture. The benefits of niacinamide may be especially helpful for blemish-prone skin and mature skin, since this ingredient can help soothe skin 
and help minimize the appearance of wrinkles and large pores.</pre></p>
 
<br>
<h3>Hyaluronic Acid</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Don't be fooled by the word "acid", this one isn't the one that burns! It actually keeps your skin very hydrated and moisturized and it still have much more benefits! 
Hyaluronic acid is widely used as an ingredient in fillers that repair or conceal scars left behind by acne. Hyaluronic acid is generally safe for all skin types and doesn't 
typically lead to any adverse reactions when applied topically.</pre></p>

<br>
<h3>Vitamin C</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Vitamin C is a science-backed, dermatologist-favorite ingredient that may help slow early skin aging, prevent sun damage, and improve the appearance of wrinkles, 
dark spots, and acne. Vitamin C may also help protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet rays when used in combination with a broad-spectrum sunscreen. This 
ingredient is mostly from tangerines, lemons, and oranges. topically. Vitamin C can be found in serums or other skincare products. Different formulations of vitamin C 
can alter its strength and effects in the skin. </pre></p>
<br>
<h3>Salicylic Acid (BHA)</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Salicylic acid (SA) is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that helps promote the skin’s natural exfoliation process. Originally derived from the bark of certain plants
—such as white willow and wintergreen leaf—salicylic acid is most often created in a lab today. This ingredient has long been used to target various concerns, including 
rough and bumpy skin (also known as keratosis pilaris), clogged pores, and skin conditions like psoriasis. When used as part of your skincare regimen, this 
ingredient’s mild yet effective exfoliating properties can help leave your skin feeling softer and smoother.
</pre></p>
<br>
<h3>Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA)</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>AHA is mostly combined with BHA in products for greater exfoliation. AHAs can be a good alternative to other methods of exfoliation, such as using abrasive brushes, 
scrubs, or face cloths. These methods of mechanical exfoliation can be harsh and cause irritation. Acid exfoliants, such as AHAs, can remove rough or flaky skin 
without causing irritation. As a result, they can reduce the appearance of dry skin, blemishes, and keratosis pilaris. Over time, and with exposure to the sun, the 
turnover of new skin cells slows down. This can increase the appearance of fine lines and wrinkl, AHAs help to remove the top layer of dead skin cells, revealing 
fresh new cells underneath. With long-term use, AHAs may also increase collagen and elastin in the skin. These substances give the skin structure and elasticity, 
but they naturally decrease with age. By using AHAs regularly, people may notice their skin looks plumper.
</pre></p>
<br>
<h3>Retinol</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Retinol helps neutralize free radicals in the middle layer of your skin. This can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and enlarged pores. It may also reduce 
symptoms in people with some skin conditions. Retinol is one of the best-known skin care ingredients on the market. An over-the-counter (OTC) version of retinoids, 
retinol is derived (made from) vitamin A and is primarily used to treat mature-looking skin concerns as well as acne. Retinol is a type of retinoid, which is made from 
vitamin A. It does not remove dead skin cells, as many other products for mature skin do. Instead, the small molecules that make up retinol go deep beneath the 
epidermis(outer layer of skin) to your dermis.  </pre></p>
<br>
<h3>Bakuchiol</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Bakuchiol is derived from the psoralea corylifolia plant, and is a powerful antioxidant. And like retinol helps to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Unlike retinol though, 
it has no adverse side effects on skin. And because it's entirely unrelated to vitamin A, it's safe for pregnant women and those breastfeeding. Because it tends to gentler 
on the skin than other anti-aging ingredients (like retinol), bakuchiol can be used every day, and in fact, when used twice a day, bakuchiol has been studied and shown 
to be just as effective as retinol. </pre></p>
<br>
<h3>Yogurt</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>Yogurt is not only known to be a good food for the intestinal system but also a safe skin care product. When applying yogurt directly to the skin, the product will have
the effect of smoothing and rejuvenating the skin. Eating yogurt will help beautify the skin from the inside.The biggest advantage of yogurt in skin care is its
high benignity, environmental friendliness, and reduced risk of facial skin irritation. Women with sensitive skin can also use yogurt to make a mask. So what 
ingredients in yogurt make it so effective? The zinc ingredient in yogurt helps to reduce inflammation and firm the skin. According to research, about 100 grams of 
yogurt will have 1 mg of zinc. This mineral also works to regenerate cells and tissues, remove dead cells, sebum on the body. Many people after using yogurt on 
their face found that their acne condition was significantly improved. </pre></p>

<h2>Skin Types</h2>
<br>
<h3>How to figure out what skin type you have</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>If you did our survey, you'd already know, if you haven't let's find out here!</pre></p>
<br>
<h3>First Test: The Bare-Faced Method</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>● Next time you wash your face, remember to check how your skin feels afterwards.

● If your skin becomes really tight, dry, and uncomfortable, you probably have dry skin.

● If your skin just stays normal, not too flaky or tight nor oily, then you have normal skin!

● If your skin exhibits both oily and dry areas, you likely have combination skin.

● If you still have excessive shine all over, then your skin would fall into the oily skin category.

● If your skin gets all red, and irrtated even after a gentle touch, then you probably have sensitive skin.
</pre></p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Second Test: The Blotting Sheet Method</h3>
<br>
<p><pre>● If you still aren't sure with the first test, here's another one! But this one includes blotthing paper/sheet, so if you don't have any then stick with the first method!

● Press a clean blotting paper against different areas of your face. Then, hold the sheet up to a light to see how much oil was absorbed:

● The more oil on the paper, the oilier your skin is likely to be.

● If you see little to no oil, you may have dry skin.

● If the blotting sheet reveals minimal oil from your T-zone only, you probably have a combination or normal skin type.

● For best results, we recommend doing this test around midday or evening—blotting your skin too soon after cleansing can skew the results.

<br>
<h3>Acne</h3>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Hyperpgmentation</h3>
<br>
<pre>Hyperpigmentation is a common condition that makes some areas of the skin darker than others. “Hyper” means more, and “pigment” means color. Skin gets its 
color from a substance called melanin, which is made by skin cells. When those skin cells are damaged or unhealthy, they can produce too much melanin. The melanin 
can clump, causing that area to appear darker. 

● Try products with Vitamin C to fade those dark spots away!</pre>
